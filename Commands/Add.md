# git add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you will want to keep, yo'll need to use the `git add` command.

Items that have not been "tracked"before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you can get away with a command `git add .` which will add ALL files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.

You can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will trackspecifically file1 and file2.
